### Introduction

YouTube Downloader is a tool based on [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp?tab=readme-ov-file) that allows you to easily download YouTube videos to your computer.

### Installation
#### Automatic installation (easy and quick, recommended)
1. Clone this Git repository or save it as a zip file anywhere on your computer.
2. Move to the main folder of this program, where the `launcher.py` file is located.
3. INFO: By performing step 4 or 5 the script will probably install Python and ffmpeg, if they are not already installed on your computer. These programs are necessary to run this program correctly.
3. If you are on Windows simply doubleclick the windows_launcher.bat file. A dialog will pop up which warns you of a danger to your computer. You have to execute the file nevertheless. That happens due to a missing signature from Microsoft for the batch file, which unfortunately costs lots of money.
4. If you are on Linux/MacOs, move in the command line at the same folder and run the command `chmod +x mac_os_or_linux_launcher.sh` followed by `./mac_os_or_linux_launcher.sh`. Now you can always start this program via `./mac_os_or_linux_launcher.sh` from this directory.
